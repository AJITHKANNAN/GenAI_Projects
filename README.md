ðŸ§  About This Repository

This repository showcases a collection of Generative AI projects built using Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro models.
Each project demonstrates practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in areas such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), chatbot development, text summarization, document understanding, and intelligent data analysis.

The implementations highlight efficient prompt engineering, model integration, and evaluation workflows â€” designed for experimentation, learning, and real-world problem-solving with Gemini-based GenAI solutions.
